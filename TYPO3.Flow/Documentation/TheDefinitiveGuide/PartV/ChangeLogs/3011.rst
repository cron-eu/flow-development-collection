`BUGFIX: Fix calling shutdownObject() on doctrine proxy <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/731>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This change fixes #613 by creating the code to also call `shutdownObject()` on Doctrine Proxies. The proxy generation did not took into account that in `__wakeup()` the current Object can be an Instance of a Doctrine Proxy and therefore did not registered the `shutdownObject()` method on the ObjectManager.

As stated in #613 the temporary files from `Resource::createTemporaryLocalCopy()` where not removed, but with this fix they will be removed as expected.

Thanks to @monofone and @hlubek for support in finding the bug and implementing the solution and tests.

`BUGFIX: Redis backend should prevent iteration of duplicate entries <https://github.com/neos/flow-development-collection/pull/709>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When setting or flushing by tag the list of entries is not correctly
updated. This could also occur if an entry is expired.

This change fixes the flush by tag behaviour to correctly remove
entries and adds a check into the iteration of cache entries to check
for existing entries.
